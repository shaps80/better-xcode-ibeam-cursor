Better Xcode ibeam cursor
=================

Better i-beam (text cursor) for Xcode for dark background / light text color themes.

### Directions:

##### The easy way

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shaps80/better-xcode-ibeam-cursor/master/install.sh | bash 
```

##### The manual way

1. Clone this repository (or fork it if you want to customize the tiff yourself!)
2. Create a backup of `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/SharedFrameworks/DVTKit.framework/Resources/DVTIbeamCursor.tiff`
3. Copy (`sudo cp`) the tiff to `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/SharedFrameworks/DVTKit.framework/Resources/DVTIbeamCursor.tiff`
4. Restart Xcode


You should now have an i-beam that is more easy to see on a dark or black background.

### Background

I find it more enjoyable to code with the Midnight color theme in Xcode, but found myself always hunting for the cursor, especially on a large monitor. I found a pretty good TIFF someone created, so I cleaned up a bit of the outline thickness and posted it here!
